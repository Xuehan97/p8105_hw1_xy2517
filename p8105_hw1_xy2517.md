All the libraries needed in this project.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

# Problem 1

Create a dataframe comprised of numeric, logical, character, and factor
variables.

``` r
datatypes_df <-
  tibble(
    num_vec = rnorm(10,0,1), # numeric variable
    logic_vec = num_vec > 0, # logical variable
    char_vec = c("Stephen","Durant","James","Klay","CP3","Davis","Giannis","Joker","Harden","Irving"), # character variable
    factor_vec = factor(c("S","S","A","A","B","A","S","A","S","A"), levels = c("B","A","S")) # factor variables and order them
  )
```

Take the Mean of each variable of the dataframe.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
mean(pull(datatypes_df, 1)) # try the mean for numeric variable
mean(pull(datatypes_df, 2)) # try the mean for logical variable
mean(pull(datatypes_df, 3)) # try the mean for character variable
mean(pull(datatypes_df, 4)) # try the mean for factor variable
```

From the results, I can see that only numeric and logical variables can
be put in the mean() function.

Then convert logical, character and factor variables to numeric.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(datatypes_df,2))
as.numeric(pull(datatypes_df,3))
as.numeric(pull(datatypes_df,4))
```

Conclusions:

Logical and factor variales can be converted to numeric with function
as.numeric, however, character variables can’t.

-   For logical variables, “TRUE” equals to 1 and “FALSE” equals to 0.

-   For character variables, they cannot be converted to numeric.

-   For factor variables, they can be converted to numeric according to
    the alphabetical order by default unless you give them order at the
    beginning.

# Problem 2

After installing packages “palmerpenguins”, load dataset “penguins”.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Then, try to get some descriptive statistics of this dataset.

## Description 1: Names/values of important variables

``` r
head(penguins,5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 8
    ##   species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_~ body_mass_g sex  
    ##   <fct>   <fct>           <dbl>         <dbl>            <int>       <int> <fct>
    ## 1 Adelie  Torge~           39.1          18.7              181        3750 male 
    ## 2 Adelie  Torge~           39.5          17.4              186        3800 fema~
    ## 3 Adelie  Torge~           40.3          18                195        3250 fema~
    ## 4 Adelie  Torge~           NA            NA                 NA          NA <NA> 
    ## 5 Adelie  Torge~           36.7          19.3              193        3450 fema~
    ## # ... with 1 more variable: year <int>

``` r
penguins = drop_na(penguins)
```

Drop the NA values.

As we can see, this dataset contains some main characteristics of
penguins which includes species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year. There
are 8 columns and 3 factors, 3int and 3 doubles types of data are
included.

There are three penguin species and three living islands. The average
bill\_length is 44mm, average bill\_depth is 17mm, average
flipper\_length is 201mm, average body\_mass is 4207g. 165 of them are
female and 168 of them are male.

## Description 2: Size of the dataset

There are 333 rows and 8 columns in this dataset.

## Description 3: Relation between bill\_length and flipper\_length

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() + 
  ggtitle("Relation between bill_length and flipper_length") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
